mixxing are argument we add in classes

The LoginRequired mixinÂ¶
When using class-based views, you can achieve the same behavior as with login_required by using the LoginRequiredMixin. This mixin should be at the leftmost position in the inheritance list.


from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin

class MyView(LoginRequiredMixin, View):
    login_url = '/login/'
    redirect_field_name = 'redirect_to'

you have to put the LoginRequiredMixin first


LOGIN_URL = '/login' this in the setting will make the page redirect back to the login view
